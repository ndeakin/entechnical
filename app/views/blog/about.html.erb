			You're in the right place if you want to read about
			programming and technology.

		<p class="about-body">
			I'm Nick, a Canadian engineering student who is intrigued by
			clever applications of technology. This blog is a place where
			I will discuss my interests that relate to programming, web
			design, and occasionally other technology-related topics.
		</p>
		<p class="about-body">
			I have only recently become interested in web design, however
			I am loving all that there is to learn and I wish that I became 
			interested sooner.  My programming experience has primarily	been
			with C, C++, and all sorts of Visual Basic.  I am	currently
			enjoying learning more about Ruby on Rails, Javascript,	and CSS.
			But who knows what it will be tomorrow!
		</p>
		<p class="about-body">
			My main reason for starting this blog is to learn.  Therefore,
			if there is a better way to accomplish something that I
			demonstrate on this website, I will appreciate it if you take
			the time to	let me know.  If you would like to contact me for
			this reason, or even just to say hi, you can reach me at
			<a class="email" href="mailto:nick@entechnical.com">
				nick@entechnical.com
			</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="about-end">
			So that's a little bit about who created this.  I hope you
			enjoy it!
